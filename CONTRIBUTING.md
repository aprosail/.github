# Contributing to the Repos

There are something you need to know before contributing to
any of the repos in this organization.
All repos here follow the same contributing guideline listed below.

## About the Branches

Most of the repos here are trying to be simple.
There's only a `main` branch and a `dev` branch by default.
If you are not a member of this organization,
please fork the corresponding repo and pull request to the `dev` branch.
We will not accept pull requests to the `main` branch.

If you are a member of this organization,
please create a new branch from the `dev` branch,
and pull request to the `dev` branch.
Only main maintainers of corresponding repos
can merge pull requests to the `main` branch.

As for the branch name, please follow the `kebab-case` style.
You can name your branch as what you are doing on such branch.
And if you are a member of this organization,
please add your name as the prefix of the branch name,
for example: `your-name/what-you-are-doing`.

If you're not a member of this organization,
you don't need to add your name as the prefix of the branch name,
because once fork and pull request,
your GitHub username will be automatically
added as the prefix of the branch name.

## Add Your Name

Once contributing to the repo, you can add your name
into the "Maintainers and Contributors" section
of the `README.md` file in the corresponding repo.

Maintainers are sorted by relevance,
while contributors are sorted by alphabetical order.
And previous maintainers who will not get involved in the future
should be placed inside the Contributors section.
And there are different parts for
code contributors ("code") and documentation contributors ("docs").
If you'd contributed to source code but comments only,
please add your name into the "docs" section rather than the "code" section.

The name format should follow the rules listed below:

1. Use a name in pure ASCII characters as prefix and sort as it.
2. Add your committing email address wrapped in `<>` as suffix.
3. (Optional) you can also add your name
   in other languages wrapped in `()` between them.

For example (those names and emails are just for example):

```txt
Ahmed Mohammed (أحمد محمد) <ahmed@example.com>
Ivan Smirnov (Иван Смирнов) <ivan@example.com>
John Smith <john@example.com>
Jurgen Muller (Jürgen Müller) <jurgen@example.com>
Sato Jiro (佐藤次郎) <sato2@example.com>
Zhang BeiHai (章北海) <zhang3@example.com>
```
